This mod provides an additional way to fortify your Frontline with new bunker structures:

[u]General[/u]:

- This should be fully compatible with [1.0] savegames
- You need to do research in order to get these structures.
- The bunkerroof is not a real roof as of terms of game mechanics, you still will have to build a room like in vanilla 

[u]Structures[/u]:

*Bunker wall:*
Slope walls are the foundation of your bunker. Needs A LOT of resources to build but can withstand even the hardest bombardement. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

*Bunker embrasure:*
Waist high walls grant your pawns a spot to use their own arms in combat and also provides some cover (70%) . Also in contrast to the ordinary sanbags, enemys can't climp over these structures. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

*Bunker door:*
A heavy door granting passage inside the bunker. It can only be opened manually. Holds of fire for a long time, but costs a lot of resources. Bombs harm it more than ordinary bullets. Takes a lot of time to be set up.

*Bunkerroof:*
A semi transparent roofing. Comes in the sizes 5x5 and 3x3. *[notification: More sizes MIGHT come on demand, maybe start a discussion here.]*  Does not hold a roof by itself, it needs surroundings. Takes a lot of time to be set up.
